# rock-paper-scissors
This is my attempt at making the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using HTML< CSS and JavaScript, done as part of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course. The first objective for this project was to think through the logic of how the game works and how that might be translated into lines of code, which can be run using the browser's console. Once the core functionality was been established, I developed it further to include a graphical user interface, including some gifs I made myself, and some cool animations and transition effects I learned about along the way. This is the first interactive GUI-based game I've ever made, so I'm quite proud of how it turned out, even though it's not perfect. I had a lot of fun, learned a lot, and I'm excited to continue my Web Development journey!
