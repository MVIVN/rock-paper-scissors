# rock-paper-scissors
This is my attempt at making the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using JavaScript, done as part of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course. The first objective for this project is to think through the logic of how the game works and how that might be translated into lines of code, which can be run using the browser's console. Once the core functionality has been established, I'll start to develop it further to include a graphical user interface.
